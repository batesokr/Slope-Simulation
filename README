		Slope Simulator for a portable Immersive Virtual Reality (IVE)

What is it?
-----------
The Slope Simulator is meant as a plugin for a portable IVE that tracks 
how much a person is walking around in the real world and calculates
how much of the slope they have traversed. The calculation is done
by calculating the calories needed to traverse the slope and the
calories actually burnt by walking around then taking ratio to
determine the actual distance walked.
